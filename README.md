# Flashcards: React Native App

## About this Project
This is a React Native app that lets users quiz themselves on decks of cards (questions and answers) created by the user to test their knowledge on a certain topic. Users can create decks and cards for them. After taking a quiz, the user is able to see the percentage of correct answers for the questions in the deck. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). It makes use of stateless and stateful React components. It uses AsyncStorage to persist the users' data. It also sends daily reminders at 8:00PM if the user has not quizzed himself/herself in any given day.

## Native Platform: Android Portrait Mode Only
This app was designed entirely for Android devices. Specifically, it was tested thoroughly on an Android 7.0.0 emulator with screen size 768x1280 and also on a cell phone with the same Android version. It is not meant to work with iOS emulators and/or devices.
